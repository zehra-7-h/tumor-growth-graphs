Tumor Growth Modeling - Logistic Equation AnalysisThis project simulates tumor development using the Logistic Growth Model, a fundamental equation in mathematical biology for representing population growth under resource constraints. The project includes both analytical and numerical (RK45) solutions, parameter sensitivity analysis, and a chemotherapy intervention simulation.📊 Model OverviewThe growth of a tumor is modeled using the logistic differential equation, which accounts for the carrying capacity of the environment:$$\frac{dP}{dt} = r \cdot P \cdot \left(1 - \frac{P}{K}\right)$$Key Parameters:$P(t)$: Tumor size at time $t$ ($mm^3$).$r$: Proliferation rate (growth speed).$K$: Carrying capacity (the maximum size the tumor can reach based on nutrient/space limits).🚀 Key FeaturesThe simulation consists of four distinct analytical perspectives:Analytical vs. Numerical Solution: Validation of the SciPy solve_ivp (Runge-Kutta 45) method against the exact analytical solution.Effect of Growth Rates ($r$): Comparison of how tumors with different aggressiveness levels reach the carrying capacity.Initial Size ($P_0$) Impact: Analysis of how the starting volume affects the time to reach the inflection point (maximum growth rate).Chemotherapy Simulation: A dynamic simulation where the growth rate ($r$) is reduced on Day 10 to model the inhibitory effect of medical treatment.📈 VisualizationsTop Left: Displays the high accuracy between the analytical model and the numerical simulation.Top Right: Shows that as the growth rate ($r$) increases, the tumor reaches its maximum size significantly faster.Bottom Left: Demonstrates that larger initial tumors enter the rapid growth phase earlier.Bottom Right: Visualizes the "treatment effect," showing a clear flattening of the growth curve after the 10th-day intervention.💻 Setup and UsagePrerequisitesPython 3.xNumPyMatplotlibSciPyRunning the SimulationClone the repository and run the script to generate the analysis and plots:Bashpython tumor.py
📋 Sample Terminal OutputThe script provides detailed metrics during execution:Inflection Point: The exact day the tumor reaches its maximum growth rate ($P = K/2$).Capacity Benchmark: The day the tumor reaches 95% of its carrying capacity ($K$).Treatment Efficiency: Percentage reduction in tumor volume compared to an untreated scenario.
